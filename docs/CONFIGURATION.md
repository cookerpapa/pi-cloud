# Configuration

PiCloud separates hot administrator configuration, restart-bound operator
configuration and generated secrets.

## Administrator settings

The administrator page stores versioned settings in PostgreSQL and applies
them to new requests without restarting the cluster:

- model provider, model ID and encrypted API credential;
- Cube public-egress proxy URL and bypass list.

Ordinary tenant users cannot read or update these settings.

## Generated one-host configuration

`npm run production:init` creates a private runtime directory containing `.env`
and secret files. It is intentionally destructive-incompatible with the retired
Temporal/MinIO/Kopia deployment format.

Important operator values include:

- HTTP bind address/port;
- Pi Worker replica profile and per-Worker capacity;
- recursive Subagent maximum depth, total nodes per root Run and simultaneous
  active descendants (`PI_CLOUD_SUBAGENT_MAXIMUM_DEPTH`,
  `PI_CLOUD_SUBAGENT_MAXIMUM_NODES`,
  `PI_CLOUD_SUBAGENT_MAXIMUM_CONCURRENT`; defaults `4/32/3`);
- public-registration and tenant quotas;
- Tool, model and Turn timeouts;
- Cube warm/persistent retention and capacity;
- SSH gateway bind address/port, advertised host and generated host key;
- Workspace Volume gateway concurrency;
- Workspace deletion reaper interval and batch size;
- Kafka broker/topic names and bounded time/byte retention;
- optional GitHub and observability profiles.

The Worker requires both:

```text
DATABASE_URL_FILE
DATABASE_NOTIFICATION_URL_FILE (optional on one host; defaults to DATABASE_URL)
PI_CLOUD_KAFKA_BROKERS
PI_CLOUD_KAFKA_RAW_EVENT_TOPIC
PI_CLOUD_KAFKA_SESSION_MUTATION_TOPIC
```

In distributed deployments the first may use PgBouncer transaction pooling.
The notification URL must connect directly to PostgreSQL because `LISTEN` is
session-scoped.

No S3, MinIO, Kopia, Temporal Task Queue or execution Cell setting is accepted
by the current runtime.

## Kubernetes values

The platform and Pi Worker charts are JSON-schema validated. Required external
authorities are:

- PostgreSQL/PgBouncer and direct PostgreSQL notification URL;
- Kafka with Raw, Accepted and Session Mutation topics;
- an existing ReadWriteMany Workspace PVC/CSI backend;
- Cube API/proxy/Volume Plugin endpoints;
- provider egress proxy.

KEDA's PostgreSQL scaler reads the count of ready `control.command.pending.v1`
and `control.command.cancel.pending.v1` Outbox rows. It changes Worker replica count only; database
claim/fence logic remains the scheduling authority.

## Ordered timing constraints

Startup and CI validate relationships rather than isolated numbers:

```text
Tool execution < Tool Broker RPC timeout
model upstream timeout <= Pi model timeout <= Pi Turn timeout
model capability TTL >= Pi Turn timeout + expiry margin
Accepted/Session projection wait >= supported Control Plane recovery window
repository import lease <= repository import wait
Worker termination grace > Turn + Tool settlement window
Kafka time/byte retention >= maximum supported browser reconnect window
tenant maximum concurrent Runs >= desired active Subagents + one waiting root Run
```

Changing one value may require changing its dependents. Run:

```bash
npm run runtime-policy:check
npm run production:config
npm run helm:check
```

## Secrets

Never place credentials in committed Helm values or environment files. Use
private files/Kubernetes Secrets for database URLs, model encryption key,
Worker enrollment/management tokens, Tool Broker token, Cube API key and
metrics token. The SSH host private key and one-time ticket hashes also stay in
the trusted plane. Enterprise Kafka credentials and CA material belong in
Kubernetes Secrets/ACL configuration. Cube receives none of them.
