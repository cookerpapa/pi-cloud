# Release evidence process

PiCloud's supported release process binds a clean Git revision to seven
application images and the three images owned by its CubeSandbox execution
plane, plus machine-readable dependency/security evidence. It does not
currently push, sign, or publish images; registry policy and signing need a
separate deployment decision.

## Preconditions

- use a clean checkout at the intended release commit;
- install only the lockfile with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, then run
  `npm run dependencies:harden` to apply and verify the reviewed Pi shrinkwrap
  security patches;
- run `npm run ci`, `npm run cubesandbox:live-check`, and
  `PI_CLOUD_LIVE_CUBESANDBOX_CHECK=1 npm run production:check`;
- install the Cube platform images and register the immutable Tool template
  from the same clean Git revision;
- verify the pinned Cube template, KVM guest evidence, fixed network policy and
  live Cube Tool path; the Sandbox gate fails closed if any evidence is
  unavailable;
- choose one immutable image version. Do not reuse a published version for a
  different commit.

Build all production images with the version. The Compose wrapper derives the
full lowercase Git revision and passes both values as OCI labels:

```bash
PI_CLOUD_IMAGE_VERSION=0.1.0 npm run production:build
```

Generate evidence into an absent or empty path:

```bash
PI_CLOUD_IMAGE_VERSION=0.1.0 npm run release:evidence -- \
  --output-dir dist/release-evidence-0.1.0
```

The first Trivy invocation may download a large vulnerability database. Its
cache defaults to `.cache/pi-cloud-trivy` and is not release evidence. An
operator may select another private cache with `--cache-dir`.

## Evidence layout

```text
manifest.json
SHA256SUMS
.trivyignore.yaml
pi-cloud-root.cdx.json
images/control-plane.cdx.json
images/control-plane.vulnerabilities.json
images/control-plane.policy-vulnerabilities.json
... one SBOM/two-report set for each of ten images
```

`manifest.json` records:

- Git revision and whether the diagnostic `--allow-dirty` override was used;
- image version, exact local image IDs, optional registry digests, creation
  time, platform, and OCI labels;
- the immutable Trivy image digest and policy;
- complete and policy-effective HIGH/CRITICAL total and fixable counts;
- size and SHA-256 for every SBOM/report.

`SHA256SUMS` covers the root SBOM, manifest, and all image evidence. Retain the
whole directory next to the release record; do not keep only screenshots.

## Gate and review

The automated gate requires zero policy-effective fixable HIGH and zero
policy-effective fixable CRITICAL findings in every image. The unfiltered
HIGH/CRITICAL report remains part of the evidence, so a narrow exception never
erases the original finding. Unfixable findings and documented exceptions
require explicit review; the gate is not a statement that the image has no
lower-severity or unknown risk. Root `npm audit` remains a separate lockfile
gate.

The local scanner receives read-only `docker image save` archives, not the
Docker socket. Its root filesystem and capabilities are removed; only the
database cache and evidence directory are writable. Network is enabled only for
the one vulnerability-database refresh, then disabled for all image scans.

The `cubesandbox-tool` image scan selects Trivy's `os` package type. The guest
package inventory therefore covers the packaged Node, Python and OpenJDK
runtimes without downloading Trivy's optional Java index; repository
application packages remain covered by the root npm audit/SBOM. This override
and rationale are recorded in `manifest.json`. CI deliberately performs the
unrestricted image scan, including language packages.

The Web runtime compiles Caddy 2.11.4 from its verified release commit with a
pinned Go 1.26.6 builder and the fixed `google.golang.org/grpc@v1.83.1`, then
copies the static binary into a pinned minimal Alpine runtime. This avoids
inheriting stale packages from an older prebuilt Caddy image while preserving
the standard Caddy module set. The actual final image, not either build stage,
is what the release gate scans.

CI independently builds a matrix of all ten images, generates CycloneDX with
Anchore SBOM Action, records all HIGH/CRITICAL findings with Trivy, runs the same
fixable-finding gate, and uploads each evidence set for 14 days. Checkout,
Node, Anchore, Trivy, Gitleaks, and artifact Actions are pinned to immutable
commits in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

GitHub-hosted CI runs deterministic zero-token checks plus the ten-image SBOM
and vulnerability matrix. The matrix still builds the Cube Tool image, but the
full `cubesandbox:template-check` is a release-host precondition: rebuilding the
same large toolchain a second time on every push exceeded the hosted Runner's
30-minute budget without adding KVM evidence. CI does not pretend to execute
the KVM- and credential-dependent `production:check`; that gate also remains
an explicit release precondition on the deployment host.

No package receives a scheduler-specific vulnerability exception. Every
fixable HIGH/CRITICAL finding remains a release blocker unless a narrow,
time-bounded exception is added with its reachable attack path documented.

## Release limitations

- Local image IDs prove which bytes were scanned on that Docker Engine; they
  are not a registry signature or transparency-log attestation.
- A local image may have no `RepoDigest` until it is pushed.
- Docker build timestamps mean this process does not claim bit-for-bit
  reproducible images across hosts.
- Before publishing images, add a trusted registry, keyless or protected-key
  signing, provenance attestation, retention, and rollback policy, then verify
  the pulled registry digest instead of relying only on a local tag.
