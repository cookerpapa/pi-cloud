A real-model chat Run completed without touching Cube. A persistent conversation propagated its retention policy through the complete product path, and two coding Runs reused one running Session-bound Cube KVM guest with rotated Tool authority and higher-fence rebind. Archiving that conversation caused the retained Cube to be reaped. Platform Git metadata was verified in the trusted Volume envelope while the user Workspace contained no platform-created .git entry. A separate Run generated a deterministic 1024-file fixture without depending on an external network; after explicit source-VM destruction, its follow-up attached the same persistent Workspace Volume to a fresh Cube VM under a higher-fence activation. All Runs completed through the shared PostgreSQL queue and horizontally scalable Pi Worker pool. Provider usage, canonical Pi entries, cross-tenant API denial and explicit warm eviction were verified.
