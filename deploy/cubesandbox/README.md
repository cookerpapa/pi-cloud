# CubeSandbox primary execution plane

This directory is the operator path for PiCloud's ordinary Tool runtime.
`CubeSandboxProvider` is selected only by trusted deployment configuration; a
browser user, tenant, model response or Tool Call cannot choose it or request a
lower-security fallback.

The integration is pinned to
[`TencentCloud/CubeSandbox` v0.6.0](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/tree/v0.6.0)
at commit `8721dd151971ce3c2966482bbd32904ad98f378e`. Cube is a separate
CubeAPI/CubeMaster/Cubelet/CubeShim KVM control and execution plane, not a
Kubernetes `RuntimeClass`.

Pi, model authentication and conversation state remain in the trusted Worker
pool. Only the credential-free Tool Worker and Workspace enter Cube.

## Deployment profiles

The checked-in installer supports a single-node local validation profile on
the current WSL2/K3s host. It is useful for development and produces real KVM
isolation evidence, but it is not a multi-node production claim.

A public or business-critical deployment should follow the upstream
[installation](https://cubesandbox.com/guide/kubernetes/install),
[architecture](https://cubesandbox.com/guide/kubernetes/architecture) and
[upgrade](https://cubesandbox.com/guide/kubernetes/upgrade) guidance and use:

- separate control and dedicated compute nodes;
- KVM on bare metal or a deliberately prepared PVM compute node;
- XFS-backed `/data/cubelet`;
- private CubeAPI/CubeProxy routing and firewalls;
- rehearsed control-node, compute-node, storage and rolling-upgrade drills.

Only CubeAPI TCP 3000 and CubeProxy TCP 80/443 should be privately reachable
from PiCloud. Do not expose CubeMaster, MySQL, Redis, Cubelet, CubeProxy admin
ports or the Kubernetes API.

## 1. Initialize private runtime state

Run the normal production initializer first. The Cube initializer creates a
mode-0600 Cube API key with the same non-root owner as the other application
secrets:

```bash
npm run production:init
npm run cubesandbox:init
```

No key, traffic token or provider credential belongs in `.env`, source
control, Pi messages or a Tool microVM.

## 2. Install the pinned local Cube plane

Installation mutates K3s and requires root. On the validated WSL2 host it also
creates a stable `picloud0` dummy node interface with MTU 1500 and enforces
Flannel/Pod MTU 1450:

```bash
sudo --preserve-env=PATH \
  node scripts/install-cubesandbox-k3s.mjs
```

The installer:

- verifies `/dev/kvm`, K3s, Helm and the exact upstream checkout;
- creates a 64 GiB loop-backed XFS Cubelet data filesystem on a fresh local
  installation and safely grows an older, smaller PiCloud loopback image in
  place after verifying its file, loop device, mount point and filesystem;
- rejects an unauthenticated CubeAPI;
- installs the pinned chart and private template registry;
- rolls Cube components after a node-network change;
- verifies Cube workload interface MTU instead of trusting YAML alone;
- records the private CubeMaster and template-registry Service endpoints so a
  non-root deployment can register immutable Tool templates without receiving
  Kubernetes administrator credentials;
- writes private, bounded cluster evidence to
  `deploy/production/runtime/cubesandbox/cluster.json`.

The local installer invokes `/usr/local/bin/k3s kubectl` by default so a WSL
PATH entry that forwards to Windows `kubectl.exe` cannot silently select a
different client or credential store. A native, pinned alternative can be
supplied with `PI_CLOUD_KUBECTL_BIN`.

The egress gateway starts fail-closed when the PiCloud Control Plane is not
yet available: liveness succeeds, readiness and all proxy traffic remain
disabled, and the configuration poller keeps retrying. This breaks the fresh
installation dependency cycle without granting temporary unrestricted egress;
readiness changes only after an authenticated configuration revision is read.
PiCloud-owned Cube control images are imported and referenced by the exact
PiCloud Git revision rather than a mutable `:local` tag, so K3s cannot keep a
stale cached Gateway or Authorizer across an idempotent reconcile.
The import is a synchronous containerd operation followed by an inventory
check; installation does not depend on K3s eventually noticing a mutable tar
file in its asynchronous image-import directory.

Do not bind Flannel to WSL's loopback device. Its 65536-byte MTU advertises an
unusable jumbo MSS and black-holes ordinary CubeProxy responses once packets
exceed the real path MTU.

## 3. Commit, build and register the immutable Tool template

Template identity is tied to a clean, committed PiCloud revision. After code
and documentation are committed:

```bash
sudo --preserve-env=PATH \
  node scripts/register-cubesandbox-tool-template.mjs
```

The standard installer records the private CubeMaster and registry endpoints,
and stores the pinned `cubemastercli` beside the cluster evidence. A subsequent
non-root production deploy therefore uses Cube's official CLI without receiving
Kubernetes administrator credentials. An operator can still override all three
values explicitly:

```bash
PI_CLOUD_CUBE_MASTER_ADDRESS="<private-cubemaster-address>" \
PI_CLOUD_CUBE_MASTER_CLI="/opt/cube/bin/cubemastercli" \
PI_CLOUD_CUBE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS="<private-registry-address>" \
node scripts/register-cubesandbox-tool-template.mjs
```

The CLI must be built from the pinned Cube v0.6.0 revision. The script invokes
Cube's `tpl create-from-image`, `tpl watch` and `tpl list` contracts directly.
It binds an ephemeral raw TCP relay to `127.0.0.1:5000` only while pushing the
image, uses a temporary empty Docker client configuration because this private
registry needs no interactive credential helper, then destroys both temporary
resources. CubeMaster, the registry and their management ports remain private;
this path deliberately avoids granting the PiCloud runtime or its Sandbox
Manager broader Kubernetes RBAC.

The registration command:

1. builds `deploy/cubesandbox/Dockerfile.tool` from the exact Git revision;
2. runs the local Tool protocol compatibility gate;
3. pushes the image to the private registry and resolves its digest;
4. registers only port 49984 and probe `49984 /health`;
5. waits for CubeMaster to report the template `READY`;
6. records the revision, image digest, template ID and spec SHA-256 in the
   private `runtime/cubesandbox/template.json`.

Before the build and after registration, the command applies an PiCloud-only
template retention policy. It preserves the selected template and the newest
READY rollback templates, ignores templates owned by other products and never
deletes an in-progress build. The default is three READY templates and can be
changed to a bounded value from 2 through 10 with
`PI_CLOUD_CUBE_TEMPLATE_RETENTION`. Retention failure is reported without
invalidating a successfully registered immutable template; operators should
resolve the reported Cube control-plane error before storage pressure grows.

The image contains Node 24, Java 17, Python 3.11 and Git 2. It replaces Cube's
inherited entrypoint so root `envd` is not started; otherwise that daemon would
create a second command/file channel outside PiCloud's Tool Broker.

## 4. Run the real KVM gate

After production initialization and startup, the gate reads the private
cluster/template evidence and service credentials from the configured runtime
directory. It also discovers the running Workspace Volume Gateway without
printing any secret:

```bash
npm run cubesandbox:live-check
```

The gate creates real microVMs for isolated tenants and proves:

- a guest kernel distinct from the host and `cubesandbox-kvm` evidence;
- uid/gid 1000, no new privileges and zero effective capabilities;
- no Docker socket, Kubernetes token or platform/model credential;
- a fenced interactive PTY works while the unmediated envd channel remains absent;
- same-path canaries remain different across tenant Workspaces;
- a stable public HTTPS endpoint is reachable;
- CubeAPI, platform endpoints, private/link-local networks and metadata are denied;
- path, symlink, output, timeout and process limits;
- content-hashed Workspace capture;
- cancellation destroys the executing guest;
- zero remaining PiCloud activation in Cube inventory.

The local Docker template check is compatibility evidence only. It must never
be reported as KVM isolation evidence.

## 5. Deploy the product

Normal production commands now select Cube automatically:

```bash
npm run production:config
npm run production:build
npm run production:up
npm run production:ps
```

`production:deploy` also initializes Cube's private runtime state. Startup
fails closed when cluster evidence, template status, image digest, template
specification or PiCloud Git revision does not match.

The primary Compose overlay starts two credential-free fixed-target relays.
The Tool Broker remains on internal networks, holds the Cube API key from
the private file, and forces every create request to allow only the governed
public proxy plus deployment-configured RFC1918 CIDRs while denying all other
egress and public inbound traffic. The per-microVM Cube traffic token remains
inside the trusted Provider.

Cube is the only Tool and environment-setup runtime. Project recipes execute in
the same deployment-owned Cube boundary and use the configured Web proxy when
their commands require public HTTP/HTTPS. There is no alternate bootstrap
runtime or fallback.

The guest receives `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` for the trusted Cube egress
gateway. The gateway can hot-route new connections through the
administrator-configured WSL/host upstream proxy while continuing to deny
private, link-local, metadata and platform destinations except RFC1918 CIDRs
explicitly configured by `PI_CLOUD_CUBESANDBOX_DIRECT_PRIVATE_CIDRS`. Those
CIDRs are also added to `NO_PROXY` for direct company-network access. Proxy-unaware
protocols do not gain an implicit direct route through that gateway.

## Lifecycle and rollback

Cube compute instances are not data authorities. The installer loads the
`picloud-posix` binary Volume Plugin into CubeMaster and Cubelet. Each
deterministic Workspace-bound physical Volume is a trusted envelope:

```text
picloud-posix-<volume-id>/
├── .pi-cloud-runtime/
│   ├── generation
│   └── git/
└── workspace/
```

Cube mounts only `workspace/` at `/workspace`. The trusted Workspace Volume
Gateway validates and indexes that persistent Volume in place. PostgreSQL
Fence/CAS publishes only the current Attempt's revision metadata as the
Workspace head. The guest cannot
list or mutate the sibling generation marker or PiCloud's external Git
baseline.

The bundled single-node profile maps
`runtime/state/cube-shared/volume` at `/data/cube-shared/volume`. A multi-node
operator must replace that local path with the same POSIX shared filesystem on
CubeMaster, every Cubelet and the Volume Gateway. That filesystem must provide
the replication and backup policy required by the deployment's recovery claim.

Conversation state and content-verified Workspace revision metadata commit
through PostgreSQL. For an exact Session, the root-owned Tool supervisor
closes the old Run's Tool Worker, briefly freezes user processes while the
trusted Volume Gateway flushes and indexes `/workspace`, resumes those exact process
identities, and retains the running VM for the bounded warm TTL. A later
higher-fence Run rotates the private handoff secret and starts a fresh Tool
Worker. Failed, cancelled, timed-out or ambiguous transitions destroy the
guest; a later Run attaches the same persistent Volume to a fresh base-template
guest.

Operational inspection and teardown remain available even if the source
revision has advanced beyond the last registered template:

```bash
npm run production:ps
npm run production:logs
npm run production:down
```

Starting or restarting requires a READY template for the current commit.
Before uninstalling Cube, verify its inventory has no PiCloud activation.
Removing the chart does not automatically revert node labels, taints,
`/data/cubelet` data or any PVM host-kernel change.
